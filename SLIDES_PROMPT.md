Here is a detailed, structured prompt for an AI tool to generate a new slide deck that rigorously complies with the style and structure of the current "AI\&RnD Presentation Template small2."

-----

### **AI Slide Generation Prompt: \[Insert Specific Topic Here\]**

**Primary Objective:** Generate a 10-15 slide professional, high-impact corporate presentation on the topic of **\[INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC TOPIC HERE\]**. The deck must replicate the visual style, structural flow, and design constraints of the "AI\&RnD Presentation Template small2" provided.

**1. General Style and Tone**

  * **Audience:** Internal or external business/IT professionals, R\&D teams, or technical leadership.
  * **Tone:** Authoritative, professional, concise, and strategic.
  * **Aesthetics:** Replicate the minimalist, clean, and structured corporate aesthetic of the source template. Use a dark background/light text scheme, or vice versa, with high contrast.

**2. Design and Formatting Constraints (Strict Adherence Required)**

  * **Text Limitation:** The most critical constraint is *minimal text per slide*. Text should be limited to short, sharp phrases and bullet points. Avoid long paragraphs.
  * **Bullet Point Rule:** Where possible, use bulleted lists.
      * **Max 5 Bullet Points per content slide.**
      * **Max 15 words per bullet point.**
  * **Typography:** Maintain a clear font hierarchy. Use different font sizes to delineate titles, main content, and supporting text. Use bold/italics *sparingly* for emphasis only, as seen in the template.
  * **Layout:** Embrace significant white/negative space. Slides should not feel cluttered. Limit the number of distinct information blocks to 3-4 per slide.
  * **Visuals:** Incorporate professional, relevant graphics, illustrations, charts, or icons. Visuals must support the message and should occupy a dedicated space on the slide (like the 16:9 or 1:1 image placeholders), rather than being placed randomly.

**3. Required Structural Components & Slide Flow**

The final deck **must** contain these specific slide types, in a logical order, based on the template analysis:

| Slide Type                      | Template Reference (Example)         | Content Purpose & Rules                                                                                                                                                          |
